%# @deftypefn {Function File} {} [A B] = gamfit (@var{R})
%# Finds the maximumlikelihood estimator for the Gamma distribution for R
%# @seealso{gampdf, gaminv, gamrnd, gamlike}
%# @end deftypefn

%# This function works by minimizing the value of gamlike for the vector R.
%# Just about any minimization function will work, all it has to do a
%# minimize for one variable. Although the gamma distribution has two
%# parameters, their product is the mean of the data. so a helper function
%# for the search takes one parameter, calculates the other and then returns
%# the value of gamlike.

%# Note: Octave uses the inverse scale parameter, which is the opposite of
%# Matlab. To work for Matlab, value of b needs to be inverted in a few
%# places (marked with **)

function res = fb_gamfit(R)

avg = mean(R);

% This can be just about any search function. I choose this because it
% seemed to be the only one that might work in this situaition...
a=nmsmax( @gamfit_search, 1, [], [], avg, R );

b=a/avg;      % **

res=[a 1/b];

% Helper function so we only have to minimize for one variable. Also to
% inverting the output of gamlike, incase the optimisation function wants to
% maximize rather than minimize.

function res = gamfit_search( a, avg, R )
